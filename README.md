# Energetics Laboratory Teaching Repository

Repository for the Energetics class. All experiments were designed by Dr. Anilkumar, performed analyzed by me as the TA, and later performed with the students. 

## Table of Contents

- [Heat Exchanger](Heat%20Exchanger/)
- [Wind Turbine](Wind%20Turbine/)
  
## Folder Overview

### 1. Wind Tunnel
This folder contains experiments that investigate the relationship between the drag coefficient and Reynolds number for different objects placed in a wind tunnel. The experiments aim to explore how the drag force changes with different flow conditions and the geometric properties of objects.

#### Key Topics:
- Calibrating the wind tunnel velocity
- Drag Coefficient vs. Reynolds Number
- Flow characteristics at various Reynolds numbers
- Influence of object shape on drag coefficient

### 2. Heat Exchanger
This folder focuses on the study of heat transfer in a liquid-liquid heat exchanger. The experiments investigate the relationship between flow rates and heat transfer coefficients, as well as the effectiveness of the heat exchanger as a function of the Number of Transfer Units (NTU).

#### Key Topics:
- Flow Rates vs. Heat Transfer Coefficient
- Effectiveness vs. NTU for liquid-liquid heat exchangers
- Heat transfer performance under different operating conditions

### 3. Wind Turbine
This folder explores various factors that influence the performance of wind turbines, including power generation, efficiency, and the effects of different operational conditions.

#### Key Topics:
- Angle of Attack vs. Power Generation
- Load Resistance vs. Power Generation and Efficiency
- Wind Speed vs. Power Generation and Efficiency

## Usage
